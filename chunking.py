The detective entered the abandoned house just before midnight. The rooms were silent, and the windows were covered with dust. On the table, he found a bloodstained note.

The man who did the crime was John. Nobody in the village trusted him, but he had disappeared three days before the murder. The detective immediately realized something was wrong.

The next morning, the detective returned to the house. Behind a loose brick, he discovered a photograph of John standing beside the victim. This finally connected John to the crime.
